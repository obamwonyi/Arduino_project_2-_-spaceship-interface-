## ARDUINO SPACESHIP INTERFACE (project 2)

__In this project I simply built a cinematic form of space ship control that was common in old Holly Wood science fiction movies__

__The basic functionality is to have a *GREEN LED* ON when power is supplied and when the push button is held down, the in process lights(two RED LEDs) flickers with a time interval of 250ms between them.__


### COMPONENTS USED :
* Three LED's of colour GREEN, RED and RED
* Push down button
* **Arduino UNO**, for both power supply and input/output control to LED's
* Four resistor of the various resistance, 10kohms, 220ohms(3)
* Breadboard
* Jumpers
* USB  Type B(for Arduino connection).

### HOW TO RUN PROJECT
* Make the circuit connection of the various component above with the aid of the circuit diagram(spaceship_diagram.png) provided in the folder
* Clone or download this repository
* Load (open) the spaceship.ino file into you arduino IDE
* Upload it to you arduino.
